# Day 2 - Python Mini Project (Data Analytics Path)
This mini-project focuses on:
- Using loops (`for`, `while`)
- Logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)
- Control flow statements (`break`, `continue`, `pass`)
- A simple user authentication simulation

✅ Hands-on practice for mastering Python fundamentals.

📘 Day 3 — File Handling (Python)
🎯 What I Learned Today

Day 3 focused on the core file operations every Data Analyst must master:

1️⃣ Text Files (.txt)

Create, read, write, and update text files

Used open(), read(), write(), and with

Learned how to handle missing files safely

2️⃣ CSV Files (.csv)

Write rows using csv.writer

Read data line-by-line with csv.reader

CSV is the most common format in analytics → used in Excel, SQL imports, pandas, dashboards

3️⃣ JSON Files (.json)

Save Python dictionaries as JSON (json.dump)

Load JSON back into Python (json.load)

Useful for APIs, configurations, and structured data storage

4️⃣ Exception Handling

Protected file operations with try / except / finally

Prevents script crashes when files don't exist or data is invalid

A must-have skill for any data-processing script

5️⃣ Mini Task — Secure Note

Built a simple script that:

Takes input

Saves to .txt, .csv, .json

Reads back safely
This builds the habit of storing/retrieving data cleanly.

📂 Day 3 Files Added

🚀 Why This Matters for a Data Analyst

Today’s skills are the base for:

Importing raw data

Cleaning & transforming datasets

Working with APIs

Writing automation scripts

Preparing data for analysis or dashboards

Strong file handling = smoother data projects ahead.
